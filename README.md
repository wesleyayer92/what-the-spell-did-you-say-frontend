# What The SPELL Did You Say?!

## Note

Unfortunately as a first-time, self-taught React Native project, it is incredibly rough and unable to be put 
on any platform where people can try it out. It was incredibly difficult to get set up for development for React Native without
Expo which didn't have support for the modules we needed. As such the project is abandoned. A video of the project in action is
available at [wesleyayer.com](http://wesleyayer.com)

## Description

A learning application that helps you practice spelling. Using words from Scripps National Spelling Bee Competition, 
this application will quiz you on how to spell words by hearing the spoken word, along with the definition, and part 
of speech-just like a spelling bee competition. This application tracks your progress as you work your way through 
the library of words provided by Scripps.

## Motivation

Initially we had started with the idea of using an api built by Merriam Websters' Collegiate Dictionary
which eventually turned into using lists of spelling be words to develop a mobile app that would test you on your spelling skill.
